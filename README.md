## Examples in this Repo

- `bayesnet`: Introduces the Python implementation of Bayesian Networks
- `chain`: Demonstrates how Markov Chain works
- `hmm`: Implements the Hidden Markov Models that uses observations to make predictions

Need to use the `pomegranate` package. Try `pip install pomegranate`, if doesn't work, try `conda install pomegranate` in the conda environment for this project
